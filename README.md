# Building a dataflow graph for java

This repo contains the slides for a very short presentation I gave about creating a
dataflow graph for java.

I also made a poster about the same topci. You can fint it on [my wesbite](https://lukas.pietzschmann.org).

## Build it
1. You need to clone using the `--recursive` switch
2. Just call `latexmk` on the `main.tex` file

If you don't want to build the slides yourself, you can also download them [here](https://github.com/LukasPietzschmann/java-dataflow-graph/files/13249805/main.pdf).
